         <p>Digital transfer printing is ideal for ceramic, metal and certain kinds of plastic, namely those that are hard and rigid. &nbsp;If youâ€™re thinking of running a promotional gifts campaign with mugs and flasks, digital transfer is how you will get your company's logo onto the items.</p>
         <p>The process involves digitally printing the logo onto transfer paper. However, before the image can be transferred, the promotional item must be treated with a special chemical. Once this has been done, the transfer paper with the design is placed onto the item and thus, transferred. Following this, another chemical is placed onto the item so as to seal the transfer.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>The result is a permanent placement of your business's logo onto a useful promotional product that will be enjoyed for years to come.&nbsp;</p>
