         <p>Using laser engraving to brand a promotional item produces a flawless design. Laser engraving is highly accurate and is able to replicate a company's logo perfectly, which ensures a consistent corporate identity, which is key to reaching wider audiences through brand awareness.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>Clients are able to engrave in colour and in black and white, depending on the colour of the laser used.</p>
         <p>We are also able to employ laser engraving on a wide range of promotional items, from metal to organic products. We simply adjust the type of laser used – YAG or CO2 – so as to ensure that the items retain their original quality.&nbsp;</p>
