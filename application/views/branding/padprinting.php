         <p>Pad printing is excellent to use on a number of items for transferring logos and company details, particularly those that are difficult to print on, such as pens and key rings. They are also the perfect way to print a lot of items quickly, but still retain quality.</p>
         <p>It works by using a plate that is imprinted with the desired design. This is placed into ink within a special pad printing machine. A silicone pad then transfers the ink with the design onto the promotional item. Once this is complete, the item then undergoes a process whereby the ink is bonded to it. This typically involves passing it through an oven to “set” it.&nbsp;</p>
