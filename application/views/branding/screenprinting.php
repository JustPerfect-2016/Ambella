         <p>Screen printing is ideal for placing logos and company details onto a range of materials, from clothes to canvas. The process uses a technique that involves light exposure, and a stencil of the logo that is to be printed onto the item. <strong>Screen printing is also known as silkscreen printing</strong> due to the fabric that is used in the process. Ink is pushed through the silkscreen and the stencil using a fill blade, and with Ambella, the result is a beautifully printed logo on a promotional item.</p>
         <p>Clients can choose to print in black and white or in colour and the detail is excellent. However, note that it is not quite perfect; super fine details should be avoided so that bleeding of the ink does not occur.&nbsp;</p>
