         <p>Sublimation only works on artificial, man-made materials, such as polyester. There is a large assortment of items that are ideal for this kind of branding process, from clothes like nylon t-shirts, to umbrellas, a perfect gift for the rainy months.</p>
         <p>Sublimation allows for colour printing that is accurate and long-lasting. Images are printed digitally and so allow for a great deal of detail and precision.</p>
         <p>The design is digitally printed onto transfer paper with special kinds of inks. The transfer paper with the logo is placed onto the promotional gift, after which heat is applied so as to complete transfer.&nbsp;</p>
