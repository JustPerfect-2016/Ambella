                  <p>The latest piece of smart technology to become a worldwide phenomenon is the remote <a href="http://ambella.co.za/corporate-gifts/"><strong>selfie stick</strong></a>.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Gone are the days when social photos require the use of a designated photographer, because with the selfie stick, everybody gets to be captured in the moment.</p>
                  <p>Pucker those lips or smile without that awkward outstretched arm getting in the way, ruining your mojo. <br>Don’t stress about that stranger you asked to take a photo of you and your friends running off with your phone or camera, as you are now quite capable of taking an amazing photo yourself.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Unsurprisingly, the selfie stick phenomenon started in Asia, before moving to the USA and now finally South Africa has been swept up in the selfie storm.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The design of the selfie stick is as simple as its functionality.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>A telescopic rod extends out with adjustable clasps at the top that attach to any smartphone device. Selfie sticks can extend up to three or four feet, allowing for wide-angle shots from virtually any angle imaginable. Photos are taken using a self-timer or blue tooth remote which controls the camera's shutter.</p>
